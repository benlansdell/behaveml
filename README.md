# BehaveML

Supervised learning for animal behavior.

Interprets pose-tracking files (currently only from DLC), behavior annotations (currently only from BORIS) to train a behavior classifier. 

## Installation

```
pip install behaveml
```

### Advantages

* Can import data from a range of sources
* Comes with some general data processing methods, e.g. can filter DLC tracks and interpolate at low-confidence points
* More general than SimBA and MABE
* Lightweight, no GUI... just use in jupyter notebook. Or can be put into a fully automated pipeline this way
 and be given to experimentalists. Train them to use DLC, BORIS and then run the script/notebook to do behavior classification
* For some problems (mouse tracking), good baseline performance 
* Extensible, add your own features;
* And try your own ML models or use good baselines
* Active learning... train classifier on one video, inference on the rest, and suggest chunks of 

## Quickstart

Import
```
from glob import glob 
from behaveml import VideosetDataFrame, clone_metadata
from behaveml import compute_dl_probability_features, compute_mars_features
```

Gather the DLC and BORIS tracking and annotation files
```
tracking_files = glob('./tests/data/dlc/*.csv')
boris_files = glob('./tests/data/boris/*.csv')
```

Setup some parameters
```
frame_length = None              # (float) length of entire horizontal shot
units = None                     # (str) units frame_length is given in
fps = 30                         # (int) frames per second
resolution = (1200, 1600)        # (tuple) HxW in pixels
```

Create a parameter object and video dataset
```
metadata = clone_metadata(tracking_files, 
                          label_files = boris_files, 
                          frame_length = frame_length, 
                          fps = fps, 
                          units = units, 
                          resolution = resolution)
dataset = VideosetDataFrame(metadata)
```

Now create features on this dataset
```
dataset.add_features(compute_dl_probability_features, 
                     featureset_name = '1dcnn', 
                     add_to_features = True)

dataset.add_features(compute_mars_features, 
                     featureset_name = 'MARS', 
                     add_to_features = True)
```

Now access a features table, labels, and groups for learning with `dataset.features, dataset.labels, dataset.groups`.
For example:
```
from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier, RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

model = RandomForestClassifier()
predictions = cross_val_predict(model, dataset.features, dataset.labels, dataset.groups)
score = accuracy_score(dataset.labels, predictions)
```
