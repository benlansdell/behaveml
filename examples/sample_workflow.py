## General todo list ##
#######################

#TODO
# * Write a bunch of tests... make sure it's behaving as it should. Get coverage up to 90% (?)

# * Clean up the MARS code...

# * Rewrite stacking code in our new formalism... shouldn't need to use the MARS stacking code I wrote, 
#   idea is that things are cleaner for that sort of thing now

# * Make a cleaner feature creation interface? One that can support any animal config

# * Check row order is preserved by DL model. Otherwise it's useless

# * Better way of getting parameters to feature creation step...like framewidth may be useful, for instance?

# * Add a way to enforce, for each feature creation function, that it has the columns it needs.
#   Add a 'req columns' field somewhere. The names should matter
#   Perhaps there should be a 'Feature' class... that has property req features

# * Move read BORIS function to io.py

# * Add HMM on top of all this jazz

# * Add F1 optimizer on top of all this jazz

# * Add DLC filtering code

# * Documentation

# Also want to do some EDA and QC. So let's check:
# * Plots of the DLC tracks
# * Filtering options for the DLC tracks
# * Video of BORIS labels

#DONE

# * Make it so that raw tracking columns are not added as features by default
# * Add a column renamer -- say you labeled your columns differently in DLC, this will 
#   name them as expected by the 'req_columns' field for the features you want.
# * Get rid of warning messages when load CNN pre-trained parameters
#expect_partial() on the load status object, e.g. tf.train.Checkpoint.restore(...).expect_partial()

#The feature creation functions take:
# * Pandas data frame (dataset.data)
# * A list of column names that indicate which columns in the data frame 
#   the features will be computed from. For basic feature, this will be the 'raw' pose-tracking column names
#   For 'model stacking' models, this can be derivative column sets
# * A dictionary, animal_setup, that contains details about the animals in the experiment
# They return 
# * Pandas data frame with the new features, in the same order as input data

#Now all the work of the package is done, more or less, and 
# we can do ML on this object in e.g. sklearn by using the following attributes:
# dataset.features #The feature matrix setup for learning w
# dataset.label    #The labels for supervision
# dataset.group    #Used for group-level cross validation 
#                   (by default, groups are set to filename, so this implements video-level CV)
